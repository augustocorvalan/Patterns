## The basic building blocks of a repeating pattern (figures)

#### 1. Element
 - The smallest indivisible component of a repeat pattern
#### 2. Motif
 - composed of two or more elements
#### 3. Meta-Motif
 - Two or more motifs combined to create a meta-motif
#### 4. Symmetrical repetition
 - Once the element, motif or meta-motif has been created it can be used to generate a repeat pattern using one or more of the basic symmetries




## The 3 ways in which we can create repeating patterns using figures 
#### 1. One Element + Symmetry Operation
#### 2. Motif + Symmetry Operation
#### 3. Meta-Motif + Symmetry Operation



## Different symmetry operations
#### 1. Translation Symmetry
 - The movement of the figure a described distance in a described direction the repetition of a figure along a line so that all the figures are exactly alike
#### 2. Rotation Symmetry (TODO) -
 - the duplication by rotation of a figure around a central point
#### 3. Reflection Symmetry
#### 4. Glide Reflection Symmetry (TODO)

TODOS:
- [ ] Add the rest of the symmetry operations
- [ ] More types of Elements (currently just text, nice to add geometric shapes, images)
- [ ] Add the ability to create motifs and meta-motifs out of elements
